# GraphQL API

Govern Server is exposing a GraphQL API that lets you fetch data related to your Govern DAOs. Here is the complete list of queries and types that are available.

## Queries

### `dao(name: String!): Dao`

Use this query to get a single DAO, using its name. See the `Dao` type to know more information.

### `daos: [Dao]`

Use this query to get the list of DAOs.
